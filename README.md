### Pokémon Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project implements an image recognition and classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify and categorize images of Pokémon from Generation I. Inspired by the challenge of recognizing unseen Pokémon, the model aims to achieve accurate classification across a diverse set of Pokémon species.

**Dataset:** [Pokémon Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lantian773030/pokemonclassification)

**How to Run:**
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, either on VS Code or any code editor (Google Colab is recommended).
2. Download and extract the dataset.
3. Place the notebook file (`.ipynb`) in the same directory as the extracted dataset.
4. Open and run the notebook to execute the model.
